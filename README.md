This repository contains basic Arduino projects and exercises designed for learning **Arduino programming**, basic **electronics**, and **hardware interaction**.  
The exercises are progressive, starting from very simple sketches to slightly more complex interactions with buttons and sensors.

## 📚 Included Projects

Projects are organized in **numbered folders** to indicate learning progression:

- **01.basic_led_on** – Turn on an LED  
- **02.led_blink** – Blink an LED using timing  
- **03.police_led** – Police light simulation with LEDs  
- **04.button_led** – Control an LED with a button  
- **05.sensor_piezo_led** – Control an LED using a piezo sensor

**Comments on the structure:**

* **`docs/`**: Ideal for circuit diagrams, images of the hardware setup, or additional notes.
* **`exercises/`**: Numbered folders indicate progression from simpler to more advanced exercises.
* **Individual folders**: Each folder contains a single `.ino` Arduino sketch file. Descriptive names help understand what the exercise is about.
* **`.gitignore`**: Prevents temporary files generated by Arduino IDE from being tracked.
* **`LICENSE`**: Allows safe sharing and reuse of code.
* **`README.md`**: Serves as the main guide for the repository.

## ▶️ How to Use

1. Open **Arduino IDE**.
2. Open the folder of the project you want to run (e.g., `exercises/01.basic_led_on/`).
3. Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.
4. Select the correct board (e.g., Arduino Uno) and port.
5. Upload the sketch to your Arduino.
6. Observe the circuit behavior.
